Problem stmt


1) Object should have faciltiy of tranportation over n/w
  we have serializable marker interface whenevr a clas implements it,
  at runtime required functionality will be attached to transport object
2) Object should be supported to store inside file system

   since we are sending data over n/w ,data can be in byte code format
   to get the data and send the data to and fro over a channel and store it in a file,
   we need streams  (from io)

   This entire process is called Serialization.

   stored data is in form of byte code so to make it readable we need Deserialization

       FileOutputStream,ObjectOutputStream            remote   ObjectInputStream,FileInputStream
Java app---------------over n/w----------------------->HDD------------------------->remote Java App
         srerialization                             derialization


   The process of saving or writing state of an object to a file is called Serialization but stirctly
   speaking it is the process of converting object from jaa supported form to to other n/w supported form
   /file supported ofrm
   By Using FileOutputSTream,ObjectOutputStream we can have Serialization

   SAVING THE STATE OF AN OBJECT INTO FILE IS CALLED SERIALIZATION

   The process of reading state of an object to a file is called De Serialization but stirctly
   speaking it is the process of converting object from  file supported form to java supported form
   By Using FileInputStream,ObjectInputStream we can have Serialization

   READING THE OBJECT FROM FILE TO JAVA APP IS DESERIALIZATION



   IMP points
   1)serilization can only be performed for serilizable objects
   2)an obj is said to be serilizable iff the corresponding class implements serilizable MI
    The reqd ability will be provide by jvm
   3)we can add any no of obj to the file  and can read all those objects from the file but
   in order which we wrote obj, the same order the object willl come back.
   4)I f we try to serilize non srializable object then expect NotSerializableException
